# numo.framer

This is the final Framer prototype created by Team numo, MHCI 2018.

The functional prototype replicates the real-feel experience of our concept FutureFinder. It pulls data dynamically from an Airtable database and it uses an algorithm to determine the user's personality type and job card results.
